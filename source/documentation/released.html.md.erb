# Released

We will continuously update our releases as they become available.

## What you need to do

You can now test with the Trader Test service within the sandbox environment. 

Trader Test will automatically simulate and give you responses just like in a real life scenario. You can also request NCTS support staff to generate the manual responses as if Border Force staff are processing your goods. 

For more information read [this guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/940784/NCTS_Trader_Test_Access_Channels_and_Support_v1.1.pdf)
