# What we're developing now   

We will update these and release them as soon as they are ready. We expect this to be in the next few weeks.

## Project developments    

| **Project** |**Description** |
|------|-------------|
|**Test Support API**| You will be able to place CTC test messages as if they were from the NCTS. It is for use with HMRCâ€™s sandbox environment only. Check out [Test Support API specifications](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders-test-support/1.0)|Test Support API|
|**Complete departures endpoints**|You will be able to test all the departures endpoints in HMRC's sandbox environment|

## Gathering feedback   

We are carrying out research with developers, testers and business managers. If you would like to be part of our research, please can you get in touch  with your usual contact, or email [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk).

## Improving our documentation

As we get your feedback we try and respond to it as fast as we can to improve our documentation and add clarity. We are also continuing to improve and update our documentation.
For example, items we are currently working on include:

- XML mapping guides  
- Plain language error descriptions within response messages  
- Trader test pack content  


## On-going API development

At present our major focus is to prepare for the move to Trader Test in October 2020.

We continue to and improve and refine our API as well as making sure it works harmoniously with other areas of HMRC. If you find any bugs in our service, please get in touch with our developers direct through the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/hmrc/common-transit-convention-traders/issues).
