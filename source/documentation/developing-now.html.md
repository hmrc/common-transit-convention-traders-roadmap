# What we're developing now   

We will update these and release them as soon as they are ready. We expect this to be in the next few weeks.

## Project developments

|**Test Support API**| You will be able to place CTC test messages as if they were from the NCTS. It is for use with HMRCâ€™s sandbox environment only. Check out [Test Support API specifications](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/1.0)|Test Support API|
|**Complete departures endpoints**|You will be able to test all the departures endpoints in HMRC's sandbox environment|
