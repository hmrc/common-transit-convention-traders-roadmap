[Learn about key NCTS5 dates](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/#ncts5-key-dates).

### What weâ€™re working on now

1. **Upcoming Release of CTC Traders API v2.1: Supporting Testing for Transitional and Final State Rules:**
    We are developing a new version of the CTC Traders API, v2.1, which will serve as the production version for final state rules. Once available in the sandbox environment, v2.1 will enable customers to test their integrations against the final state rules, complementing the current transitional rules testing using version v2.0 in the sandbox. Further updates will be provided as we progress with this release.

2. **Technical Interface Specification(TIS) Changes from TaxUD:**
    We are currently working on implementing changes to the TIS, which will introduce updates to our API. This is an important enhancement that will impact how you integrate with our system. Further details will be provided as we progress with this work.
