### What are we working on now?

### What is coming next?
A Beta version of the departure declaration API endpoint (IE015/CC015C), which will allow developers to start a phase 5 movement using a departure declaration.

## Phase 4

**Important information**

The closure of the legacy New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) XML channel started to take place on 28 February 2022 and was expected to be completed on 13 March 2022.

To support developers who are still migrating clients, declarations made into the legacy XML channel will continue to be accepted whilst the closure process is in progress. This will give you a final opportunity to move your customers on to the new XML API channel.

As previously stated, the decision to decommission the legacy XML channel is designed to provide greater support to the new XML API and Web portal.

It will not be possible for HMRC to continue to support this legacy channel, so we do not foresee any extension to this date.

**Please note**:

 - The NCTS legacy XML channel will no longer accept any new declarations after 11:59pm on 13 March 2022.
 - The NCTS legacy XML channel will shut down at 11:59pm on 13 March 2022 and there will be no access until 7am on the 14 March 2022.
 - Between 7am on the 14 March 2022 and 11:50pm on 14 April 2022, the legacy XML channel will allow users to send or receive messages in relation to Transit movements in flight at 11:59pm on 13 March 2022 only.
 - We have changed our previously published intention to close the e-mail channel on 28/02/22.  This will now take place on 31/05/22.

If you have any customers using the Common Transit Convention (CTC), you should have completed the work needed to enable them to continue to make declarations using the new CTC XML API. 

It’s important to ensure your customers are equipped to use the new XML API channel and have the proper registration details such as Government Gateway credentials and that you’ve prepared them to make transit declarations.

We have already contacted your customers to update them on the current position and you may receive questions from them on this subject.

If you have any questions or any issues with completing the move to the new XML channel, get in touch with your usual contact or email [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk).
