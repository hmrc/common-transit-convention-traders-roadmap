# CTC Traders API Roadmap

This roadmap explains the development plans for the Common Transit Convention Traders API. It's for teams who are creating software that interacts with our new API. We hope you find it useful. 

We will update this roadmap as and when developments and dates change. 

### Terminology:


_Ready for test_: Functionality is available in sandbox for you to test.


_Our backlog_: Our upcoming priorities for the API.



## _Ready for test_


| **Arrivals** | **Description** |
|------|-------------|
|**Submit Arrival Notification message (IE007)** |Send an Arrival Notification message to the Office of Departure|
|**Resubmit Arrival Notification message (IE007)**|Resend an Arrival Notification message to the Office of Departure if the first message was rejected|
|**Send an unloading remarks (IE044)** |Send a message to the office of destination know that the goods have been unloaded|

We will be moving from an external test API using sample data, to Trader test using real data on 1st October 2020.
