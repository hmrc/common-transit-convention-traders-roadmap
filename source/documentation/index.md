# Common Transit Convention Traders API roadmap


We have created the Common Transit Convention (CTC) Traders API to allow traders to send and receive Arrival and Departure Notifications to customs and border offices in the UK and the EU.  

The roadmap shows you our development plans as well as endpoints and projects we have finished. We are an Agile team and we will be updating this roadmap as we complete items and start working on new ones.

We are now in live production for GB only.
