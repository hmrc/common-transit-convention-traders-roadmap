# Common Transit Convention Traders API roadmap

**Important news:**

HMRC recently announced the intended closure of the legacy New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) XML channel which will take place on 30 November 2021. 

The ‘legacy’ email channel is still available for use and we will notify you once a decision has been made when this will be closed down.

Please note:

 - No new transit movements must be submitted using the NCTS XML channel **after 30 November 2021**. You cannot submit any declarations using the legacy system after this switch off date.
 - Any transit movements submitted to us before 30 November 2021, which are still progressing in our system up to 30 days after this date, will still be processed. Movements using the legacy system that begin after switch off will not be processed.
